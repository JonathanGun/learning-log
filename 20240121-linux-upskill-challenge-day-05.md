# Brief

I continued the [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/), today I'll follow the [Day 5](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/05/) challenge.

# What I Learned

when using `less` command:
* I can use `/` to search for a keyword, then hit `n` to go to the next match
* I can use `&` to filter the output. this can be used multiple time.

* I can use `history` to see the command history, then use `!<number>` to run the command again
* Using `!<command>` will run the last command that starts with `<command>`

* I can edit the default "prompt" of the shell by  using `PS1` variable.

# Ideas to Explore in the Future
