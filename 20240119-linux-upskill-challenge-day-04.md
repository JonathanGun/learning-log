# Brief

I continued the [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/), today I'll follow the [Day 4](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/04/) challenge.

# What I Learned

* `apt` command has search capability using `apt search <keyword>`
* difference between `apt` and `apt-get`. https://itsfoss.com/apt-vs-apt-get-difference/
    * `apt` is newer and has more abstraction
    * `apt` has progress bar
    * `apt` automatically list upgradable packages
* fedora used another package manager called `dnf` instead of `apt`

# Ideas to Explore in the Future
