# Brief

I continued the [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/), today I'll follow the [Day 2](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/02/) challenge.

# What I Learned

Not much about the challenge itself because I already familiar with `ls`, `mkdir`, `cd`, `pwd`, and `touch` command. But here are some fun facts that I learn along the way:

* Instead of `mv` we can also execute `rename`
* Common convention for a backup file is to append `~` at the end of the filename
* Ubuntu has `apropos` command to quickly search a keyword from manual page
* `/etc/skel` is a directory that contains default files for new user
* `/usr/bin` has lot of interesting commands, which I might explore other day
* You can practice pronounciation using google search
* `/var` stands for variable. that's why logs are stored in `/var/log`
* `/var/spool` is a directory that contains files that are queued for processing, i.e: print queue
* command `cd` without argument will bring you to home directory
* we can sort `ls` output by file size using `ls -S`
* we can sort `ls` output by file time using `ls -t`

# Ideas to Explore in the Future

* explore commands in `/usr/bin`
