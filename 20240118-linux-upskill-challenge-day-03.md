# Brief

I continued the [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/), today I'll follow the [Day 3](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/03/) challenge.

# What I Learned

* we can add new user using `adduser` command
* we will be asked to enter full name, room number, work phone, home phone, and other information when adding new user
* I learn how to add user as sudoer using `usermod -aG sudo <username>`
* I can't execute `hostnamectl` and `timedatectl` command because I'm using docker. can't find a solution for this yet

# Ideas to Explore in the Future
