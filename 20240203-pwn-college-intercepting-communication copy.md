# Brief

In [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/), I'm currently learning about [intercepting communication](https://pwn.college/intro-to-cybersecurity/intercepting-communication).

# What I Learned

Related to how packet are structured, I learned about the following:

* Internet Protocol (IP). The first octet denotes the version of the protocol used. We heard about IPv4 and IPv6. `4` and `6` are the first octet of the IP packet.
* Where is IPv5? In 2011, the last remaining IPv4 were allocated. IPv5 was using the same 32-bit address space as IPv4, so it would suffer with the same problem. So IPv5 is abandoned before it is publicly released.
