# Brief

I completed the rest of `bandit` levels from Over The Wire Wargames.

# What I Learned

## OTW - bandit

* You can go to `vi` editor from `less` or `more` by pressing `v`.
* You can set shell on `vi` editor by running `:set shell=/bin/bash`, then execute the shell by running `:sh`.
* git tag can store an object, you can view it by running `git show <tag-name>`.

I completed the rest of the levels (up to level 34)
