# Brief

I continued the [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/), today I'll follow the [Day 6](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/06/) challenge.

# What I Learned

I learn how to edit a file using `vi`.

* We can move the cursor using `hjkl` keys. `h` is left, `j` is down, `k` is up, and `l` is right. I thought it was `ijkl` because it's like arrow keys, but it's not.
* We can jump to the beginning of the line using `:0` and to the end of the line using `:$`. 
* When I do `33dd` it deleted 33 lines. I can undo that changes by pressing `u`. I can also do `33yy` to copy 33 lines.
* I can go to the beginning of the file using `gg` and to the end of the file using `G`.
* I found graphical vi cheat sheet [here](http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html)
